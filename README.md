# RESTful TUTORIAL

This project involves implementing a Django RESTful API using different approaches across multiple Git branches. Each branch will contain the same functionality but implemented differently. The main goal is to create an API that returns JSON responses for two classes: books and writers. Here's a breakdown of the project structure:

Project Plan:
Main Branch:

Implement the API using Django Function-Based Views (FBVs).
Branch: DCBVs

Implement the same functionality using Django Class-Based Views (CBVs).
Branch: DRF-FBVs

Evolve the FBV implementation using Django Rest Framework (DRF) and the @api_view decorator.
Branch: DRF-CBVs

Extend the DCBVs branch by implementing the API with DRF's APIView class and response modules.
Branch: DRF-CBVs-ViewSets

Further evolve DRF-CBVs using DRF ViewSets for the implementation.
Branch: DRF-CBVs-ModelViewSets

Final evolution using DRF ModelViewSets, simplifying the code by leveraging DRFâ€™s built-in capabilities.
